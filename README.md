# FizzBuzzLearningExcercise
An intro programming challenge to start someone off in a new language.

The Ruby Users group in Grand Rapids has put together a basic training for learning Ruby. Take a look [here](https://github.com/WestMichiganRubyTraining/challenges/tree/master/ruby)

We'll be aiming to complete a FizzBuzz similar to the `Classy` step there.

## FizzBuzz Rules:
Output a set of numbers (say, 1-15), but whenever a number is divisible by 3, you output “Fizz” instead. If it’s divisible by 5, you output “Buzz” instead. If it’s divisible by 3 and 5, you output “FizzBuzz” instead.
